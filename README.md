# NEYA_FINAL

A site I developed for a local, non-profit group called NEYA (New England Youth Alliance). Note: The site is complete from
a structural and functional standpoint, but the groups have yet to populate the site with their personal info.

# Languages

D3.js, JQuery, AJAX, HTML, CSS

# Features

1) Interactive Display of Current Program Offerings  
   Instead of uploading a boring spreadsheet listing all available activities and their respective meeting times
   I used D3.js to create a bubble diagram, where each bubble represents an activity. Filtering functionality allows
   users to view activities by seasons of the year or days of the week. The cool part? It's animated!! Check it out:

2) E-mail Form

3) CSS Animations
